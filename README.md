To create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically, the purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

The Descision Tree Classifier is created and is visaulized graphically. Also the prediction was calculated using decision tree algorithm and accuracy of the model was evaluated.
Using a Decision Tree classifier and visualizing it graphically is a common approach in machine learning for both understanding the decision-making process and making predictions on new data. Decision trees are intuitive to interpret, making them suitable for tasks where transparency and explainability are important.

When you train a Decision Tree classifier on a dataset, it learns a set of hierarchical if-else questions based on the features of the data, leading to the classification of each instance into a particular class. Visualizing the tree graphically helps in understanding which features are most important in making the classification decisions and how the data is partitioned into different classes.

Once the Decision Tree classifier is trained, it can be used to predict the class labels of new, unseen data. By following the same decision-making process learned during training, the classifier can assign the appropriate class label to each new instance based on its feature values.

However, it's important to note that Decision Trees have limitations, such as overfitting to the training data and being sensitive to small variations in the data. Techniques like pruning or using ensemble methods like Random Forests can help mitigate these issues.

Overall, using a Decision Tree classifier and visualizing it graphically can be an effective approach for classification tasks, providing both interpretability and predictive capability.
